This kit combined Root and GEANT 4 code. The most useful Utility of both languages are used in here, including the ROOT data file and simulation power of the GEANT4.

This system will take a root file which detailed its input particles' kinmetic and produce a root file output in Data output

The Generator will generate 1 particle per event and each particle kinmetic is specify by the root file input . 

And pls Use the distribution_generator.cpp to generate the correct root file with the correct format

The build target of the executable is bacis_setup.exe

PLEASE!!!!!
run the code said on your terminal in your G4 terminal

You can change everything needed for simulation and control the entire simulation  in the UDInCodeControllingSurface

The other thing you need to be a aware of the line 78 in the DataCollection
as the current config will allow you to get all info from the lower plate
